This plugin serves as a faux web service that outputs data from the WP Database to a Flash application in any way you wish.


== Description ==

This plugin serves as a faux web service that outputs data from the WP Database to an application in the format of XML or JSON. It is intended to make managing data for applications easier by leveraging WordPress' awesome admin and data management.
<br>
This plugin insures that the requesting party is a valid user of the API before outputing any data or executing a function. 
<br><br>
<i>* PHP and WordPress knowledge is required to create your own functions and data outputs.</i><br>
<i> ** Be sure to backup your services.php file when updating to newer versions of the plugin.</i> 


== Installation ==

1. Upload `flash_api` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Click Flash API from the `Admin -> Settings` Menu
4. Set the Application key (this is generated by default but it is wise to change this)
5. See the `wp-content/plugins/flash-api/includes/test.php` file as an example on how to create a function
6. Upload your new function file to the `/flash-api/includes` directory
7. Create a new API Function post (Note: This is how the API recognizes your function and includes it). Be sure to title your post the same as the function you created
8. Set the Includes Path in the Flash API Options box like so: includes/yourfunction.php (note there is no `/` prefix
9. Publish your function
10. Test your function by navigating to the service like so... http://yourwebsite.com/wp-content/plugins/flash-api/wsrv.php?apiKey=YOURKEY&service=YOURFUNCTIONNAME=&yourparam=YOURPARAMVALUE

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create a function? =

See `Installation` documentation

= How do I use this with my app? =

The example is for flash but the API can be used with just about anything from mobile apps to ajax/jquery javascripts<br />
See the flash example: `/wp-content/plugins/flash_api/flash_example/flash_api_example.fla`

= Can I set API keys for individual Users? =

Yes!<br />
1. Edit the user's `profile -> Flash API -> API Domain value`. <br />
2. Edit the user's `profile -> Flash API -> API API Key value`. <br />
2. Give that apiKey to the user to use for their flash apps.<br />
3. The user must specify the `domain` parameter when calling functions from mobile apps or other domains. By default, the plugin will check the `$_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"]` value for the correct domain.

You can then alter your services to work only for specific API keys by checking the `$_REQUEST["apiKey"]` value.<br />
You can also set user permissions within your services via Wordpress's user levels manangement (see http://codex.wordpress.org/User_Levels).
